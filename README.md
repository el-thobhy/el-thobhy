## El Thobhy Profile

Hy Guys, i'm Auriwan Yasper, an Android Developer (self claim Lol). But that's for real, i have android an app in google play store, you can check it out on this [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aljebrastudio.islamicstory&pcampaignid=web_share) hehe. I'm stil in progress to develop for all feature, so i'm really sorry for the simple feature hehe. 

By the way, i'm a data scientist as well. coz my thesis for bachelor degree is about "Hyperparameter Tuning in Extreme Gradient Boosting Model for Rainfall Classification: A Case Study Pontianak City". I'm using random search and grid search to optimize the hyperparameter in XGBoost model, with coarse to fine method. So, for the coarse search was using random search technique, and after the optimize hyperparameter has observed in random search then grid search was implemented to get the fine search. That's all, we get the best hyperparameter.
