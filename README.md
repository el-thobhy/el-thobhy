# El Thobhy Profile

Hy Guys, i'm Auriwan Yasper, an Android Developer (self claim Lol). But that's for real, i have an android app in google play store, you can check it out on this [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=4731263920961188643) hehe. I'm stil in progress to develop for all feature, so i'm really sorry for the simple feature hehe. 

here are my android app project:
- [Islamic Story Github link](https://github.com/elthobhy-studio/islamic-story-android), [Playstore Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=4731263920961188643). Tech Stack: Firebase Database, Clean Architecture, MVVM, Dependency Injection, Room Database. 
- [Catalog Movie](https://github.com/el-thobhy/Catalog-Movie). Tech Stack: MovieDB API, Clean Architecture, MVVM, Dependency Injection, Room Database, continuous integration, Application security, SSL Pinning, retrofit, lottiefiles, shimmer layout.
- [News App](https://github.com/el-thobhy/News-App). Tech stack: same as above
  

By the way, i'm a data scientist as well. coz my thesis for bachelor degree is about "Hyperparameter Tuning in Extreme Gradient Boosting Model for Rainfall Classification: A Case Study Pontianak City". I'm using random search and grid search to optimize the hyperparameter in XGBoost model, with coarse to fine method. So, for the coarse search was using random search technique, and after the optimize hyperparameter has observed in random search then grid search was implemented to get the fine search. That's all, we get the best hyperparameter.
